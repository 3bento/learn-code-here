> Feel free to help us.

Hi! There are simple files with a couple of course to study and learn about programming. Here we have couple differente resources, you should know a little about all of them and later just go and learn more about what you really like.

**Note:** I recommend you start as backend first. I am focus on update  the backend first. Because I know more about backend development than frontend development. :)
